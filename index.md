### Description
Qraclib is an innovative project positioned at the convergence of quantum computing and classical cryptographic algorithms. It would provide a set of quantum oracles to facilitate the evaluation of classical algorithm with qc. This project addresses the challenge of implementing classical algorithms in quantum computing environments, where classical functions may be complex and difficult to directly encode into quantum circuits.

### Needs and Motivation
In the realm of quantum computing, certain algorithms rely on oracles to evaluate classical functions efficiently. Qraclib responds to the need for a specialised library that simplifies the integration of classical cryptographic functions into quantum algorithms. This is crucial for researchers and practitioners working on quantum algorithms that require classical function evaluations.
