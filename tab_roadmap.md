## Project roadmap

Phase 1: Foundation
- Establish project goals, objectives, and a clear vision for Qraclib.
- Define the scope of the library, focusing on the implementation of quantum oracles for classical cryptographic functions.
- Listing all the algorithms to implement in phase 2
- Listing the necessary subpart implementation needed.
- Identify quantum simulation libraries to be supported by Qraclib.
Phase 2: Design and Implementation
- Choose a set of classical cryptographic functions to be implemented as quantum oracles.
- Prioritise algorithms based on their complexity.
- Consider optimisation techniques for quantum circuit efficiency.
- Implement interfaces for compatibility with chosen quantum simulation libraries.
- Implement a continuous integration pipeline for automated testing.
- Complete and publish comprehensive documentation.
- Package Qraclib for easy installation using standard package management tools.
